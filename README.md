The goal of fffi is to be able to transparently use shared libraries generated by Fortran within Python.

First tests with cffi can be made in the `draft` directory:

1. Possibly add new testing routines to `testfort.f90` 
2. Run `build.sh`. This should generate `libtestfort.so`
3. Edit and run `test_fort.py` which uses the (faster) API mode of CFFI to generate a Python extension module

Current status: 

* Subroutine signatures are right now defined via C equivalent in CFFI cdef
* Array descriptor structs are working with gfortran 7.3
* First tests to define signatures directly in Fortran syntax via Fortran parser

Next steps:

* Make code generation and invocation transparent by encapsulation and metaprogramming
* Simplify / auto-import subroutine signature generation
* Test in real world applications
